a) Yes, the number of hops between nodes of same continent are lower when compared to nodes on different continents. This can be attributed to the fact that more distance is to be travelled (hence more hops) when the connection has to established overseas.

Relatively, google and facebok has less number of hops which might be due to direct peering with the local ISPs

b) Yes, in most of the cases latency is directly related to the number of hops

c) Web servers of University of Waterloo, University of Capetown are always resorted to the same IP address and the Google, Facebook resorts to different web servers when tracerouted from different continents.(why?)

d) Yes, the paths appear different. The paths obtained for corresponding ip addresses(with the server when tracerouted with the domain name) are relatively shorter.

e)?

f)needed to check from the data with net1.txt

g)the #hops and hence the latency is higher relatively for when location of destination server is relatively farther
(comment - //Needed to check for more destination servers for better picture)
